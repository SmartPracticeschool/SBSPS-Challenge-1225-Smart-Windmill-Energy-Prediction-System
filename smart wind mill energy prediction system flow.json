Wind power is the source of Renewable Energy or Green Energy. Wind mills are used to convert the Kinetic Energy of wind into mechanical energy, and after that it will be converted into electric energy using generators.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To calculate wind energy that can be converted into electric energy at particular place, one must have-</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">a) Value of Wind Velocity</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">b) Wind turbine blade length or swept area</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">c) Density of air at that place</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">d) Total number of wind turbines in use.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; With the formula,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Power = 0.5* density of air* swept area * velocity<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We can calculate the power generated in Watt.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this web application you can find the power that can be generated using wind mills in particular area, by providing either the location name or latitude and longitude value of that region.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can provide some other optional parameters like-</p>\n<ul>\n    <li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Blade Length of wind turbine in meters.

It is the Ratio of Actual power generated to the theoritical power generated.
