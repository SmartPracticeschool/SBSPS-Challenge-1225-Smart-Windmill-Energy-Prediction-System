# SBSPS-Challenge-1225-Smart-Windmill-Energy-Prediction-System
This is the smart wind mill energy prediction system repo.
Through this user can get the energy that can be generated for next 48 hours at some particular location by installing wind mill at that location.
user can either enter the city/place name or co-ordinated of that location i,e latitude and longitude.
this system will give Maximum energy that can be generated at that place using wind mill or by considering various factor like efficieny, swept area of turbine, poweer coefficient factor etc.
User can import the 'smart wind mill energy prediction system flow' file in node red flow to operate the web page.
